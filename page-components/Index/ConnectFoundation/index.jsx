              We believe that Connect Network will drive social, political and
              economic innovation on a global scale. The Connect Foundation is
              one among many other entities in the Connect ecosystem and stands
              as part of the community in support of the Connect Network and
              ecosystem. To do so, the Connect Foundation deploys resources to
              entities and initiatives that will help to ensure the long-term
              success of Connect Network.

            We view Connect as a long-term project
              â€“ where a solid technical foundation is imperative in this crowded
              space of Layer 2 scaling networks and its global adoption. The
              role of the Connect Foundation is to sustainably deploy the
              resources that are under control to support the long-term success
              of Connect Network. This long-term success will only be possible
              with a vibrant ecentralized ecosystem. Our goal is to ensure that
              the independent organizations in this ecosystem have what they
              need to solve the challenges that lay ahead.
